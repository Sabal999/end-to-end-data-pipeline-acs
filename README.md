Welcome to the **End-to-End Data Pipeline for the American Community Survey (ACS)** dataset. This project implements a robust data pipeline using Python, PySpark, PostgreSQL, and Kubernetes, structured in a Bronze/Silver/Gold architecture. The pipeline efficiently processes and transforms ACS data, enabling users to derive insights and make informed decisions.

## Introduction

The ACS dataset provides vital information about the demographics, social, economic, and housing characteristics of the U.S. population. This project aims to build an end-to-end data pipeline that automates the extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) processes for this dataset. By leveraging modern data engineering practices, this pipeline ensures scalability, reliability, and efficiency.

## Features

- **Bronze/Silver/Gold Architecture**: Organizes data into raw, cleaned, and analytical layers.
- **Data Processing with PySpark**: Utilizes distributed computing for large-scale data processing.
- **PostgreSQL Storage**: Stores processed data in a relational database for easy querying.
- **Containerization with Docker**: Ensures consistency across environments.
- **Orchestration with Kubernetes**: Manages deployment and scaling of services.
- **Local Development with Minikube**: Facilitates development and testing in a local Kubernetes environment.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language for data processing and pipeline logic.
- **PySpark**: For distributed data processing.
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful relational database for storing structured data.
- **Kubernetes**: For orchestrating containerized applications.
- **Docker**: For creating and managing containers.
- **Minikube**: A tool for running Kubernetes locally.

## Architecture

The architecture of the data pipeline is divided into three main layers:

1. **Bronze Layer**: Raw data ingestion from various sources. Data is stored in its original format for auditing and recovery.
2. **Silver Layer**: Cleaned and transformed data. This layer includes necessary transformations and validations.
3. **Gold Layer**: Aggregated and analytical data. This layer is optimized for reporting and analysis.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sabal999/end-to-end-data-pipeline-acs.git
   cd end-to-end-data-pipeline-acs
   ```

2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up PostgreSQL and create a database.

4. Configure your environment variables.

5. Start the pipeline.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- PostgreSQL 13 or higher
- Docker
- Kubernetes (Minikube for local development)

### Step-by-Step Installation

1. **Install Python**: Follow the instructions on the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Install PostgreSQL**: Follow the instructions on the [official PostgreSQL website](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).

3. **Install Docker**: Follow the instructions on the [official Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

4. **Install Kubernetes**: Follow the instructions on the [official Kubernetes website](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/).

5. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sabal999/end-to-end-data-pipeline-acs.git
   ```

6. **Install Python Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

7. **Set Up Database**: Create a PostgreSQL database and configure connection settings in your environment.

8. **Run Docker Containers**: Use Docker Compose to run the necessary services.

## Usage

### Running the Pipeline

To run the pipeline, execute the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

This command will start the ETL process, extracting data from the ACS dataset, transforming it, and loading it into PostgreSQL.

### Accessing Data

You can access the processed data through SQL queries in PostgreSQL. Use a database client or command line to connect to your PostgreSQL instance.

## Data Flow

The data flow in this pipeline is as follows:

1. **Data Ingestion**: Raw ACS data is ingested into the Bronze layer.
2. **Data Transformation**: The data is cleaned and transformed in the Silver layer using PySpark.
3. **Data Storage**: Cleaned data is stored in PostgreSQL.
4. **Data Analysis**: Aggregated data is prepared in the Gold layer for reporting and analysis.
